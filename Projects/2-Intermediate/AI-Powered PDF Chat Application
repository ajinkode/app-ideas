# PDF Chat Assistant

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

Create a chat application that assists users in answering questions about PDF documents they provide. The application will use AI to process and answer questions related to the content of the PDF.
Just upload a PDF of your choice and the chat application will answer any of your questions!

User Stories:

As a user, I can upload a PDF document to the chat application.
I can ask questions about the content of the PDF using the chat interface.
The application should display the answers in a chat-like format for easy reading.
I can interact with the chatbot to ask more questions or seek clarification.
The chatbot should provide information about the PDF, such as the title, author, and publication date.
As a bonus feature, I can share the extracted information or answers on social media or with others.
The chat application should allow me to provide feedback on the accuracy of the answers.
Useful Links and Resources:

PDF parsing libraries (e.g., PDF.js, PDFMiner) for extracting text content from PDFs.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK) for understanding and generating responses.
